        <h2>🔥 The Story: How It All Started</h2>
        <p>It all began as a joke. I was setting up my portfolio, adding random **meta tags**, and messing around with **SEO keywords** just for fun. 💀  
        Little did I know, I was about to **accidentally hack Google's ranking algorithm** and get my site **indexed at the top.**</p>

        <h2>🚀 Step 1: The Accidental SEO Trick</h2>
        <p>One of the easiest **SEO hacks** that worked (and still works) is **meta tags optimization.**  
        I **stuffed my website's head** with **200+ keywords**, making it look like this:</p>

        <pre>
&lt;meta name="keywords" content="Dwip Biswas, dwipbiswas, SEO hacking, Google ranking, Bing ranking, 
how to rank on Google, website SEO, backlinks, search engine optimization, Python, AI, growth hacking"&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>Google and Bing crawlers were like: "👀 Hold up… this site must be important!" and started **ranking my site higher.**</p>

        <h2>🔥 Step 2: The Backlink Madness</h2>
        <p>Then I built a **Python backlink bot** that spammed my site URL to **every free SEO backlink submission site.**</p>

        <p>Here's the bot I used (don't try this at home 💀):</p>

        <pre>
import requests

# List of backlink sites
BACKLINK_SITES = [
    "https://www.pingmylinks.com/?url=https://dwip-biswas.github.io/",
    "https://www.seoheap.com/backlink-generator/?url=https://dwip-biswas.github.io/",
    "https://www.freewebsubmission.com/?url=https://dwip-biswas.github.io/"
]

# Spam the links
for site in BACKLINK_SITES:
    response = requests.get(site)
    print(f"Submitted to {site} → Status: {response.status_code}")
        </pre>

        <p>After running this, **hundreds of backlinks** were pointing to my site, and **Google ranked me even higher!**</p>

        <h2>💀 Step 3: The Google Search Console Trick</h2>
        <p>Next, I submitted my website to **Google Search Console & Bing Webmaster Tools** manually.  
        This **forced Google to crawl my site faster**, getting it indexed in hours instead of days.</p>

        <p>Go to 👉 <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank">Google Search Console</a> and **submit your site now.** 🚀</p>

        <h2>📈 The Aftermath: I Broke the Algorithm</h2>
        <p>One day, I randomly Googled my name and BOOM—  
        🔥 **My portfolio was on top of Google!**  
        🔥 **My GitHub profile was fully indexed!**  
        🔥 **Even my dumb test projects were ranking!**</p>

        <p>**Google really thought I was a big deal. 💀**</p>

        <h2>📢 How You Can Rank #1 (Without Getting Banned)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔥 **Step 1:** Use strong **meta tags** (title, description, keywords).</li>
            <li>🚀 **Step 2:** Submit your site to **Google Search Console & Bing Webmaster Tools.**</li>
            <li>🔗 **Step 3:** Get **backlinks from high-authority sites** (Reddit, Medium, Twitter, Quora, etc.).</li>
            <li>💀 **Step 4:** Don’t overdo it—**Google will ban your site if you spam too hard.**</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>👀 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This was **a fun experiment**, but also a **serious lesson** on how **SEO actually works.**  
        **If you do it right, you can rank ANYTHING on Google. 🚀**</p>
